# CS109A Sample Web site

All the interesting stuff is in the gh-pages branch.

The Multilevel modeling sample was copied from [https://github.com/fonnesbeck/multilevel_modeling](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/multilevel_modeling)

## Setup

1.   Get a copy of this repository in your local GitHub account. This is called _forking_.

    Follow the instructions at [GitHub help for forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Instead of
    `octocat/Spoon-Knife`, use `https://github.com/cs109Alabs/project_resources`

    **Important**: follow only the steps to *Fork a Sample Repository* and
     *Keep your fork synced, Steps 1 and 2*. **Do not do Step 3: Configure Git to sync your fork with the original Spoon-Knife repository**

    We want you to use this repository as a starter template and not sync back
    to it as you make your changes.

2. Publish your copy of the site as a public GitHub page
    *
